GlobalCandySales:

The GlobalCandySales sheet may appear differently when opened in non-Excel editors. This spreadsheet shows sales data from 2022-2023 for candy sales across the globe. The data includes Sales Units, Item, Item Owner and more. The data was created purely for demonstration purposes only. The dataset could be improved further by adding additional columns and increasing the overall size of the data set.

The aim with this dataset was to demonstrate various features and my skills within Excel, by cleaning and formatting the data, creating a dashboard and also an example PivotTable. Features used inlcude Data Validation coupled with a VLOOKUP formula to create a dynamic and interactive dropdown field that users can change to update the data in the dashboard. Conditional formatting was used to help visually highlight the best selling Regions & Item Owners. Sheet protection was also added to help reduce accidental deletions and maintain spreadsheet integrity, with both the data and PivotTable sheets being password protected for added security.

There are definitely some improvements that could be made to various aspects of the spreadsheet. For example, the formatting of the dashboard could be improved to make it easier for stakeholders to understand, as at the moment whilst the data is useful, it does lack cohesion and could be clearer in the message it's trying to deliver. The PivotTable could be more detailed, and in supported versions of Excel, I would prefer to apply a custom format to the data, so it's easier to read using a format such as 0.0,,,"B" to display data that is currently showing as 7,300,000,000 as 7.3B, for example.

NTS Radio: 
https://github.com/exapeta/Excel/blob/main/NTS/NTS%20Guest%20Show%20Data.xlsx

The dashboard, sheet and some styles may display differently when opening the .xlsx version of the 'NTS' spreadsheet, as it was created in Google Sheets. For this spreadsheet I used data from NTS' Guest Show catalogue between the dates of 8th - 19th October 2023. The data used included tracklistings, show hosts, dates, locations and genres featured in the shows and put together a quick dataset to use as an example.

I started off by importing the data and then profiling to understand what each data type representeted and how it could be analysed. I then cleaned and formatted the data so it was in an appropriate format for extracting insights from. I made use of a handful of formulas to organise the data as I liked, and then generated some visualisations form the organised data, presenting it in a dashboard using similar styles to the NTS brand.

This example could definitely be expanded upon, for future improvements I would definitely look at improving the dashboard formatting, and perhaps add some additional charts to help convey more information (this would be helped of course by using a larger, more complex dataset). I would also enforce more strict data management such as Conditional Formatting & Data Validation to prevent errors and help highlight potential areas of improvement. This would also be aided by more thorough data cleansing and tidying beforehand, but for illustrative purposes, the data sufficed.
