EXCEL 

For this spreadsheet I used data from NTS' Guest Show catalogue between the dates of 8th - 19th October 2023. The data used included tracklistings, show hosts, dates, locations and genres featured in the shows and put together a quick dataset to use as an example.

I started off by importing the data and then profiling to understand what each data type representeted and how it could be analysed. I then cleaned and formatted the data so it was in an appropriate format for extracting insights from. I made use of a handful of formulas to organise the data as I liked, and then generated some visualisations form the organised data, presenting it in a dashboard using similar styles to the NTS brand.

This example could definitely be expanded upon, for future improvements I would definitely look at improving the dashboard formatting, and perhaps add some additional charts to help convey more information (this would be helped of course by using a larger, more complex dataset). I would also enforce more strict data management such as Conditional Formatting & Data Validation to prevent errors and help highlight potential areas of improvement. This would also be aided by more thorough data cleansing and tidying beforehand, but for illustrative purposes, the data sufficed.
